# The greatest common divisor
## A window application that checks the greatest common divisor (gcd) in C#

### **Project creation steps:**

1. Create a project called NWD.

2. Declare three integer variables m, n, difference.

3. Download from the user the values of the variables m and n.

4. Execute until the value of variable difference is different from zero the following commands (until it is not zero).

5. From the larger number subtract the smaller, the basis result to the variable difference.

6. To the greater number with m and n bases the value of the variable difference.

7. Write on the screen that the most common divisor you are looking for is the value of the variable N. stop the program so the user can view the results.

### **Code:**

You can find the code in nwd.cs file


### **Develop environment:**

  * Windows 10
  * Visual Studio 2017
